# Background

In the era of wearable fitness devices like Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit, it has become feasible to gather extensive personal activity data affordably. These devices are central to the quantified self-movement, where enthusiasts regularly track metrics to enhance health, identify behavioral patterns, or indulge in tech-driven pursuits. While people often quantify the quantity of their activities, assessing the quality remains less common. This project utilizes accelerometer data from various body locations (belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell) of 6 participants. They performed barbell lifts in correct and incorrect manners across 5 different forms. The goal is to predict the manner in which these exercises were performed.

# Data

The training data for this project can be accessed [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv).

The test data are available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv).

The data originate from [this source](http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har).

# Load Data and Libraries

```{r}
# Read data files
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")

# Load necessary libraries
library(caret)
library(randomForest)


Data Preprocessing

# Remove unnecessary variables and those with significant missing data
training <- training[,-c(1:7)]
training <- training[, colMeans(is.na(training)) < 0.9]

# Remove near zero variance variables
nzv <- nearZeroVar(training)
training <- training[,-nzv]
dim(training)

# Subset training and validation set
set.seed(42)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(training$classe, p=0.7, list=F)
subTrain <- training[inTrain,]
validation <- training[-inTrain,]


Model Fitting and Cross-validation

# Set up 5-fold cross validation
set.seed(42)
train_control <- trainControl(method="cv", number=5, verboseIter=FALSE)

Multinomial Linear Model
# Model fitting
mnom_model <- train(classe ~., data=subTrain, method="multinom", trControl=train_control, trace=FALSE)

# Prediction
mnom_pred <- predict(mnom_model, validation)
mnom_CM <- confusionMatrix(mnom_pred, factor(validation$classe))
mnom_CM

Random Forest
# Model fitting
rf_model <- train(classe ~., data=subTrain, method="rf", trControl=train_control)

# Prediction
rf_pred <- predict(rf_model, validation)
rf_CM <- confusionMatrix(rf_pred, factor(validation$classe))
rf_CM
